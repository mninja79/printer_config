[tmc5160 stepper_x]
cs_pin: P1.10
#   The pin corresponding to the TMC5160 chip select line. This pin
#   will be set to low at the start of SPI messages and raised to high
#   after the message completes. This parameter must be provided.
#spi_speed:
#spi_bus:
spi_software_sclk_pin: P0.4
spi_software_mosi_pin: P1.17
spi_software_miso_pin: P0.5
#   See the "common SPI settings" section for a description of the
#   above parameters.
#chain_position:
#chain_length:
#   These parameters configure an SPI daisy chain. The two parameters
#   define the stepper position in the chain and the total chain length.
#   Position 1 corresponds to the stepper that connects to the MOSI signal.
#   The default is to not use an SPI daisy chain.
interpolate: True
#   If true, enable step interpolation (the driver will internally
#   step at a rate of 256 micro-steps). The default is True.
run_current: 0.850
#   The amount of current (in amps RMS) to configure the driver to use
#   during stepper movement. This parameter must be provided.
hold_current:0.500
#   The amount of current (in amps RMS) to configure the driver to use
#   when the stepper is not moving. The default is to use the same
#   value as run_current.
sense_resistor: 0.075
#   The resistance (in ohms) of the motor sense resistor. The default
#   is 0.075 ohms.
stealthchop_threshold: 0
#   The velocity (in mm/s) to set the "stealthChop" threshold to. When
#   set, "stealthChop" mode will be enabled if the stepper motor
#   velocity is below this value. The default is 0, which disables
#   "stealthChop" mode. Try to reexperience this with tmc5160.
#   Values can be much higher than other tmcs.

#   Set the given register during the configuration of the TMC5160
#   chip. This may be used to set custom motor parameters. The
#   defaults for each parameter are next to the parameter name in the
#   above list.
#diag0_pin:
diag1_pin: ^!P1.29
#   The micro-controller pin attached to one of the DIAG lines of the
#   TMC5160 chip. Only a single diag pin should be specified. The pin
#   is "active low" and is thus normally prefaced with "^!". Setting
#   this creates a "tmc5160_stepper_x:virtual_endstop" virtual pin
#   which may be used as the stepper's endstop_pin. Doing this enables
#   "sensorless homing". (Be sure to also set driver_SGT to an
#   appropriate sensitivity value.) The default is to not enable
#   sensorless homing.
